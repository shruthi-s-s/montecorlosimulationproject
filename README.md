# 🏎️ Max Verstappen World Championship Prediction Simulation – 2025 Season

## 📘 Overview
A Python simulation that predicts how **Max Verstappen** can still win the **2025 Formula 1 World Championship** using a **Monte Carlo approach**.  
It models the final 4 races — **Brazil**, **Las Vegas**, **Qatar**, and **Abu Dhabi** — including **sprint races** at Brazil and Qatar.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To simulate all possible podium outcomes (**P1–P3**) for **Max Verstappen**, **Lando Norris**, and **Oscar Piastri**,  
and determine the scenarios where Max becomes **World Champion**.

---

## ⚙️ Features
- 🔁 Simulates **10,000 possible season outcomes**  
- 🏁 Includes both **main race** and **sprint race** points  
- 🧩 Considers only **podium finishes (P1–P3)**  
- 📊 Displays **example winning scenarios** for Verstappen  

---

## 🧠 Concepts Used
- Monte Carlo simulation  
- Loops and conditional logic  
- Dictionaries for structured data  
- Randomized race outcome generation  

---

## 💻 How to Run
1. Save the file as **`f1_world_championship_2025.py`**  
2. Open a terminal or Python IDE (IDLE, VS Code, PyCharm, etc.)  
3. Run the command:
